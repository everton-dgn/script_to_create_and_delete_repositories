# :question: How to use and to set up the Project

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/everton-dgn/script_to_create_and_delete_repositories.git
```

## Configuring the script

- Copy the `functions_bash.sh` file and paste it in any folder. 
- In the example the file was copied and pasted in the user folder.
- To find the user's folder use the command `cd` to enter it and then `pwd` to show the path of the current directory.
- Locate the Bash configuration file in the user folder.
- `.bash_profile` (if using Windows) or `.bashrc` (if using Linux or Mac).
- In the Bash configuration file, first of all import the `functions_bash.sh` file.
- Importing the `functions_bash.sh` file looks like this if the file is in the user's folder:
  ```shell
  source ~/.functions_bash.sh
  ```
- Reopen the Bash terminal and run the command `create_repository` or `delete_repository`.

## Customizing the local directory path

To customize the path of the directory where the local repositories are, change lines 336, 337 and 372 of the `.functions_bash.sh` file.

## Customizing the available templates

On line 311, inside the `options` array, you can pass the names of the templates (GitHub repositories marked as templates) that you want to use when creating a repository.

On line 321, change the conditional block that refers to each position in the `options` array. 

Inside the conditional blocks, in the `use_template` variable you must insert, after the `--template` property, the exact name of the template (which corresponds to the name of the template repository on GitHub).

For the first position of the array (key 0) it was chosen to leave the option `None.`, so that if selected, the variable `use_template` will have an empty string value and thus, no template will be added when creating the repository, leaving it completely empty.
